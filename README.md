# weather_app

Weather application.

This application is live on 'https://rehan-weatherapp.netlify.app'.

I made this application for learning that, how to use third party API, and deploy project on a server. This application is fully responsive.

In this Weather application I am using:

React library for view.
Axios library for requests from API.
OpenWeatherMap service ('https://openweathermap.org') for getting weather data.

Note: The OpenWeatherMap API key in this project will not work, so replace that with your OpenWeather API key.
